## Description
> The monsters of the Wildes Land are in a constant battle for survival and only one species
> amongst them have the ability to determine which of them make it, the trainerâ€”the only monster
> with the capacity to tame itself. The monsters depend on the trainers to tame them so that they
> may reach peak power to defend themselves, and the trainers on the monsters whom are the only
> ones physically capable of providing the trainer with resources for their own survival. When a
> monster forms a bond with a trainer they become a code-a-mon, only then does a growing power
> awaken within the monster that just might give them the ability to survive. Life and the very
> nature of survival has since become a spectacle to all those visiting the Wildes Land, with the
> best view at the colossal Kampfarena.

## About
### Git & GitHub
> This program uses git for version control using GitHub as the remote repository. Please clone
> the program locally from the GitHub repository listed above.
>
> Initial commit. The initial commit is based on the Mascotmon code which comes equipped with all
> the build and test tools. The original code is included for testing purposes but is removed in
> later commits to fit the requirements for Monster Kampfarena.

### Design Patterns
> The design patterns used in the Monster Kampfarena simulation are as suggested
    
    - Decorator Pattern
      This pattern is used for code-e-mon evolutions
 
    - Factory pattern
      Builds codemon and trainer entities
      
    - Mediator pattern
      Mediates the simulation where for each tick an event occurs.
